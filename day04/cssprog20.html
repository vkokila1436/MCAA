<h2>Fixed Full-height Side Nav</h2>
<h3>Tirumala is a Hindu religious temple town 
in Tirupati district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.
It is one of the neighbourhoods of the Tirupati city.
The town is a part of Tirupati Urban Development 
Authority and located in Tirupati (urban) mandal of 
Tirupati revenue division.[4] The town is strictly vegetarian.
It is a hill town where Tirumala Venkateswara Temple is located, 
a popular shrine of Vishnu. Vishnu is believed to reside here with his full power,
as in Vaikuntha, and thus the place is also called 'Bhuloka Vaikuntha'.</h3>
<h4>Natural Arch, Tirumala hills, a notified National
Geo-heritage Monument, is a distinctive geological
feature 1 km (0.6 mi) north of the Tirumala hills temple, 
near the Chakra Teertham in Tirupati district 
in the state of Andhra Pradesh, India. The arch is also
called Silathoranam (శిలాతోరణం) in the local language
(Telugu language: sila means ‘rock’ and thoranam means a
garland strung over a threshold, connecting two vertical columns 
or an ‘arch’ as in this case). The arch measures 8 m (26.2 ft) in 
width and 3 m (9.8 ft) in height, and is naturally formed in the 
quartzites of Cuddapah Supergroup of Middle to Upper Proterozoic
(1600 to 570 Ma) due to natural erosive forces.</h4></div>
