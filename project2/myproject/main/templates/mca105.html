In an MCA (Master of Computer Applications) course, 
Accounting and financial management are related but distinct fields. Accounting focuses on recording, summarizing, and reporting financial information to external users like investors and regulators. It ensures accuracy and compliance with accounting standards. Financial management, on the other hand, involves planning, managing, and controlling a company's financial resources to achieve its goals. It focuses on internal decision-making related to investments, funding, and cash flow.
