 It's a major hub for classical dance and music,
 particularly Bharatanatyam and Carnatic music, 
and is also a center for Tamil cinema. 
Additionally, Chennai is a major industrial and technological center, 
often called the "Detroit of South Asia" due to its automobile industry,
 and is home to numerous IT parks.
