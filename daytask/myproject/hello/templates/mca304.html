System programs are software components that manage a computer's resources and provide a platform for other programs to run. They are essential for the operation and maintenance of a computer system and are typically included with the operating system. 
Key characteristics of system programs:
Core Functionality:
System programs manage fundamental computer operations like memory allocation, process management, file handling, and input/output operations. 
Interface:
They act as an interface between the hardware and application software, allowing users to interact with the system and run applications. 
Part of the OS:
System programs are often integrated with the operating system and can't be easily uninstalled. 
Examples:
Common examples include file managers, compilers, loaders, debuggers, and system utilities. 
Types of System Programs:
Operating System (OS):
The OS is the core system program that manages all other programs and hardware resources. 
Utility Programs:
These are tools that help with system maintenance and management, such as disk defragmenters, virus scanners, and backup utilities. 
Programming Language Support:
Compilers and interpreters that translate code into machine-executable instructions are also considered system programs. 
File Management Programs:
These programs handle file creation, deletion, modification, and organization. 
In essence, system programs are the foundation upon which application software is built and executed. They ensure the smooth and efficient operation of a computer system, allowing users to perform various tasks and utilize applications effectively.  Network administrators can manage and maintain resources from a central location.
