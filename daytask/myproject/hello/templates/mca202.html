<pre>
 ADBMS stands for Advanced Database Management System. It refers to a specialized class of database systems that go beyond the capabilities of traditional systems by offering advanced features and optimizations for managing complex data and demanding workloads. ADBMS is designed to handle large volumes of data, high availability requirements, and complex transactions efficiently. 
Here's a more detailed explanation:
Going Beyond Traditional DBMS:
Traditional DBMS (Database Management Systems) manage data storage and retrieval. ADBMS builds upon these foundations by incorporating advanced features like data replication, failover mechanisms, and sophisticated transaction management. 
Key Features:
Data Replication and Failover: Ensures continuous data availability even in the face of hardware or network issues. 
Complex Transaction Management: Handles complex transactions that involve multiple operations, ensuring data consistency and integrity. 
Support for NoSQL and NewSQL Databases: ADBMS often incorporates features for emerging database technologies like NoSQL and NewSQL databases that support trends like analytics, streaming, and in-memory processing. 
Active Database Functionality: Some ADBMS implementations include active database capabilities, enabling automated responses to events like database changes or external signals.
